ChicksWithScythesStoryline:
*[StartOnSelflessSide]
This group constructs a reward system that makes it so that being a good person rewards you, but the system is broken as hell, and never seems to work perfectly
*[StartOnSelfishSide]
This group focuses on personal survival. On greed, and instinct, and through this method their lives are unequivocally better. No restraint, no repression, no pain.
